# Getting Started
Welcome to Luna SDK. In this article, we will guide you to Luna SDK by creating a simple program that draws one textured 3D cube on the screen. At the end of this article, you will have a basic understanding of using Luna SDK to create a simple graphic program, and can start to explore more advanced features provided by Luna SDK.

## Prerequisites
In this article, we assume that you have the basic knowledge of C++ programming and graphics programming (like using D3D11, D3D12 or OpenGL). You should also correctly setup Luna SDK and developing environments using the instructions provided in `README.md` of the project.

## Creating the program
The first thing to do is to create an binary target for our demo program, so that XMake build system can correctly build our program. To create a new program, create a new folder in the `{LUNA_ROOT_DIR}/Programs` directory, and name it `DemoApp`. In this folder, create a new Lua script file called `xmake.lua`, and fill its content with the following text:

```lua
target("DemoApp")
    set_luna_sdk_program()
    add_files("**.cpp")
    add_deps("Runtime", "Window", "RHI", "ShaderCompiler", "Image")
target_end()
```

`target` and `target_end` enclose a *target scope*, where all target definitions are specified. `set_luna_sdk_program` tells XMake that we are defining one Luna SDK program, this will let XMake set the target kind to "binary" and import all SDK options for the program. `add_files("**.cpp")` tells XMake to add all CPP files in the current directory and all subdirectories to the this target. `add_deps` lists all libraries that this program links to, in our example, we need to link to the SDK runtime (`Runtime`), the window module (`Window`) , the Graphics API module (`RHI`), the shader compiler module (`ShaderCompiler`) and the image file module (`Image`). If you got unresolved external symbol errors when compiling, make sure you already link correct libraries.

Then we need to create source CPP files for our program. Since out demo program is simple, we only create one "main.cpp" file to host all source codes. After this, the `DemoApp` directory should looks like this:
```
DemoApp
|- xmake.lua
|- main.cpp
```
The last thing is to add one line in the end of `{LUNA_ROOT_DIR}/Programs/xmake.lua` to tell XMake to add our program in the solution:
```lua
includes("DemoApp")
```
Well done, now every is set up and we can start to program our first Luna SDK program!

## Program structure

Next, fills `main.cpp` with the following initial content. As we go further, we will add more properties and methods to our `DemoApp` structure, while remaining the rest part unchanged.
```c++
#include <Runtime/Runtime.hpp>
#include <Runtime/Module.hpp>
#include <Runtime/Debug.hpp>
#include <Runtime/UniquePtr.hpp>
using namespace Luna;
struct DemoApp
{
    RV init();
    RV update();
    bool is_exiting();
};
RV DemoApp::init()
{
    return ok;
}
RV DemoApp::update()
{
    return ok;
}
bool DemoApp::is_closed()
{
    return false;
}
RV run_app()
{
    auto result = init_modules();
    if(failed(result)) return result;
    UniquePtr<DemoApp> app (memnew<DemoApp>());
    result = app->init();
    if(failed(result)) return result;
    while(!app->is_exiting())
    {
        result = app->update();
        if(failed(result)) return result;
    }
    return ok;
}
int main()
{
    bool initialized = Luna::init();
    if(!initialized) return -1;
    RV result = run_app();
    if(failed(result)) debug_printf(explain(result.errcode()));
    Luna::close();
    return 0;
}
```
The first four lines includes the header files that we need to include to compile the program, which are:
* <Runtime/Runtime.hpp> for `Luna::init()` and `Luna::shutdown()`.
* <Runtime/Module.hpp> for `Luna::init_modules()`.
* <Runtime/Debug.hpp> for `Luna::debug_printf()`.
* <Runtime/UniquePtr.hpp> for `Luna::UniquePtr<T>`.

You can include any SDK interface header files using similar syntax: `#include <Module/File>`. We set `{LUNA_ROOT_DIR}/Engine` as the global include directory, the user may check it for available header files. In this example, all header files are from the `Runtime` module, which is the core module of Luna SDK that provides fundamental SDK features.

The next statement is `using namespace Luna`. In Luna SDK, all types, functions and variables are defined in `Luna` namespace, and every module will define its elements in nested namespace, such as `Luna::RHI`. So, we use this statement to prevent spelling the `Luna::` namespace prefix in our following code.

The program starts with the `main` function, just like any normal C/C++ program. In the main function, we firstly call `Luna::init` to initialize Luna SDK. This function should be called before any other Luna SDK function. `Luna::init` returns one Boolean value to indicate whether the SDK initialization is succeeded, if the return value is `false`, we then return `-1` and exit the program to indicate one runtime error. If `Luna::init` returns `true`, then one `Luna::close` call is need before the program exit to let the SDK clean up all internal resources.

We then wrap the real program logic in one `run_app` function. The return type of `run_app` is `RV`, which is a shortcut for `R<void>`, this is part of the error handling mechanism of Luna SDK. `R<T>` is a structure that encapsulates one return value with type `T` and one error code with type `ErrCode`, which is simply an alias of `usize` (or `std::size_t`). If the function succeeds, the returned value will be one `T`-typed value and one error code `0`; if the function fails, the returned value will be one non-zero error code, and the `T`-typed value will be uninitialized and inaccessible, you may call `errcode()` to fetch the error code from `R<T>`, and may call `explain` to get a brief description of the error. In our `main` function, we check whether our `run_app` function is failed by using `failed` helper function (there is also one `succeeded` helper function available), then we print the error description and exits the program if any error occurs.

In our `run_app` function, the first thing to do is calling `init_modules`, which will initialize all linked SDK modules for our program. We deliberately separate module initialization from `Luna::init` so that the user get a chance to set module initialization parameters before initializing modules, and modules can also indicate initialization failure by returning error codes (error handling system is available after `Luna::init`). Then, we allocate and initialize one new object of `DemoApp` type by calling `memnew` function. The following table shows memory allocation functions used in Luna SDK:

| Luna SDK functions                 | C++ functions/keywords |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `memalloc(size, alignment)`        | `malloc(size)`         |
| `memfree(ptr, alignment)`          | `free(ptr)`            |
| `memrealloc(ptr, size, alignment)` | `realloc(ptr, size)`   |
| `memsize(size, alignment)`         | N/A                    |
| `memnew<T>(args...)`               | `new T (args...)`      |
| `memdelete(ptr)`                   | `delete ptr`           |

The user should uses allocation functions provided by Luna SDK instead of those provided by C++ std. `DemoApp` will contain all states and logics for our demo program. The created `DempApp` instance will then be stored as a variable `app` with `UniquePtr<DemoApp>` type, which is a smart pointer that will delete the pointing object automatically when expired.

`DemoApp` has three functions: `init`, `update` and `is_closed`. The `init` function initializes the program, and reports errors if the initialization is failed; the `update` function updates the program state and renders the image at every frame; the `is_exiting` function checks whether the program is exiting. We will implement these three methods in the following sections. 

The rest part of our `run_app` function simply checks whether the program is exiting by calling `is_exiting`, and updates the program when it is not exiting. 

After filling this content, execute `xmake build DemoApp` on terminal or click `build` button on your IDE, you should successfully build the `DemoApp` program.

## Window creation and event handling

Now that we have one basic program structure, we need to create a system window so that we can render images to it. We also need to implement window event handling so that the program can exit when the user clicks the close button of the window.

Window creation is fairly simple, we firstly need to introduce one new header:

```c++
#include <Window/Window.hpp>
```

then we add one new property to our `DemoApp` structure:

```c++
struct DemoApp
{
    Ref<Window::IWindow> window;

    RV init();
    RV update();
    bool is_exiting();
    RV resize(u32 width, u32 height);
};
```

The window object is provided by `Window::IWindow*` interface pointer in Luna SDK, which points to a *boxed object* which manages its lifetime using *reference counting*. `IWindow` interface may have different implementations on different platforms, by they all provide the same functionality required by this interface. `Ref<T>` is a smart pointer for boxed objects, it will manage the reference counter of the pointing object automatically when being constructed and destructed, so the user does not need to call `object_retain` and `object_release` manually. You may compare `Ref<T>` to `ComPtr` used in Microsoft's Component-Object Model (COM), or the *automatic reference counting* in Apple's Objective-C and Swift. The default constructor of `Ref<T>` initializes the pointer to `nullptr`, so we need to assign it with a valid object.

Then we need to create our window in `DemoApp::init`:

```c++
RV DemoApp::init()
{
    lutry
    {
        luset(window, Window::new_window("DemoApp", Window::WindowDisplaySettings::as_windowed(), Window::WindowCreationFlag::resizable));
    }
    lucatch
    {
        return lures;
    }
    return ok;
}
```

Besides the `new_window` function that creates the window, there are four new keywords in our code: `lutry`, `lucatch`, `luset` and `lures`. These four keywords are macros that enables us to write error handling using a simpler try-catch style, rather than fetching and checking error codes once and once again for every function call that may fail. `lutry` and `lucatch` must be used in pairs, next to each other. In the `lutry` block, the user may define multiple `lulet` , `luset` or `luexp` statements, `lulet` statement creates a new local variable to hold the  return value of the function, and jumps to `lucatch` if the function fails; `luset` assigns the return value to one existing variable, and jumps to `lucatch` if the function fails; `luexp` is used if the function does not return any value, it simply checks whether the function succeeds, and jumps to `lucatch` if not. The user may also call `luthrow` manually in `lutry` block to jump to `lucatch` directly.

In the `lucatch` block, `lures` is provided as the error code that causes the failure. You may use one `switch` statement on the `lures` to handle specific errors, or you can propagate the error directly to parent function by `return lures`. Since error propagating is so commonly used, we create another macro `lucatchret` to replace `lucatch { return lures; }`, so the code above can be written as:

```c++
RV DemoApp::init()
{
    lutry
    {
        luset(window, Window::new_window("DemoApp", Window::WindowDisplaySettings::as_windowed(), Window::WindowCreationFlag::resizable));
    }
    lucatchret;
    return ok;
}
```

Since we use `goto` statement to implement `lutry` and `lucatch`, it you needs multiple lutry-lucatch pairs in one function, you should use a numbered version for every pair (like `lutry2`, `lucatch2`, `luset`2, `lures2`, etc.). In most cases, only one lutry-lucatch pair is sufficient.

Now let's get back to `Window::new_window` function that does the actual work:

```c++
R<Ref<IWindow>> new_window(const c8* title, const WindowDisplaySettings& display_settings, WindowCreationFlag flags)
```

In this function, `title` Specifies the title of the window, which is usually displayed on the title bar of the window. `flags` are a combination of `WindowCreationFlag` enumeration class that lists flags for window creation process, like whether the window is resizable by dragging the border of the window, whether the window is a border-less window, etc. `display_settings` specifies the display settings for the window, which is described by `WindowDisplaySettings` structre:

```c++
struct WindowDisplaySettings
{
	monitor_t monitor;
	i32 x;
	i32 y;
	u32 width;
	u32 height;
	u32 refresh_rate;
	bool full_screen;
};
```

Every window can be displayed in windowed mode or full screen mode, which can be specified by `full_screen`. `monitor` specifies the monitor to attach the window to in full screen mode. If `monitor` is `nullptr` and the window is set to full screen mode, the primary monitor of the system will be used. `x` and `y` are the position of the window on screen coordinates in windowed mode. The user may pass `DEFAULT_POS` constant to indicate a system-specific default position for the window. `width` and `height` are used to control the size of the window, the user can pass `0` to indicate a system-specific default size. `refresh_rate` controls the refresh rate of the window, the user may pass `0` to use the default refresh rate of the system. `WindowDisplaySettings` comes with two static functions `as_windowed` and `as_full_screen` for quickly specify all parameters in one row, with default values specified when they are skipped by the user, just as in our example.

After the window is created, we need to register window event callbacks so that we can handle window events properly. In this example, the events we need to handle is the close event (triggered when the close button of the window is pressed) and the framebuffer resize event (triggered when the window framebuffer size is changed). This can be done by the following statements:

```c++
window->get_close_event().add_handler([](Window::IWindow* window) { window->close(); });
window->get_framebuffer_resize_event().add_handler([this](Window::IWindow* window, u32 width, u32 height) {
    lupanic_if_failed(this->resize(width, height));
    });
```

`get_close_event` and `get_framebuffer_resize_event` are methods of `IWindow` that gets the close event and the framebuffer resize event object of the window. The event object is a collection of callback functions that once triggered, calls all the callback functions. We then register one callback function to the close event that closes the window immediately, and one callback function to the framebuffer resize event that calls the `resize` method of our `DempApp`. The `resize` method is currently empty, we will fill the content of this method when we create render textures later:

```c++
RV DemoApp::resize(u32 width, u32 height)
{
    return ok;
}
```

Window events are not polled automatically, we need to tell the window system to poll events at every frame by calling `Window::poll_events` in `update` function:

```c++
RV DemoApp::update()
{
    Window::poll_events();
    return ok;
}
```

This call polls events for all existing windows, so we don't need to provide specific window here. After we correctly handle the close event, we can complete the `is_closed` method of `DemoApp`:

```c++
bool DemoApp::is_exiting()
{
    return window->is_closed();
}
```

So far, the complete code for `main.cpp` is:

```c++
#include <Runtime/Runtime.hpp>
#include <Runtime/Module.hpp>
#include <Runtime/Debug.hpp>
#include <Runtime/UniquePtr.hpp>
#include <Window/Window.hpp>
using namespace Luna;
struct DemoApp
{
    Ref<Window::IWindow> window;

    RV init();
    RV update();
    bool is_exiting();
    RV resize(u32 width, u32 height);
};
RV DemoApp::init()
{
    lutry
    {
        luset(window, Window::new_window("DemoApp", Window::WindowDisplaySettings::as_windowed(), Window::WindowCreationFlag::resizable));
        window->get_close_event().add_handler([](Window::IWindow* window) { window->close(); });
        window->get_framebuffer_resize_event().add_handler([this](Window::IWindow* window, u32 width, u32 height) {
            lupanic_if_failed(this->resize(width, height));
            });
    }
    lucatchret;
    return ok;
}
RV DemoApp::update()
{
    Window::poll_events();
    return ok;
}
bool DemoApp::is_exiting()
{
    return window->is_closed();
}
RV DemoApp::resize(u32 width, u32 height)
{
    return ok;
}
RV run_app()
{
    auto result = init_modules();
    if(failed(result)) return result;
    UniquePtr<DemoApp> app (memnew<DemoApp>());
    result = app->init();
    if(failed(result)) return result;
    while(!app->is_exiting())
    {
        result = app->update();
        if(failed(result)) return result;
    }
    return ok;
}
int main()
{
    bool initialized = Luna::init();
    if(!initialized) return -1;
    RV result = run_app();
    if(failed(result)) debug_printf(explain(result.errcode()));
    Luna::close();
    return 0;
}
```

Build and run `DemoApp`, and you will see a blank window appears, and the program exits when you click the close button of the window.

## Fetching graphics device

After the window is created, we can start drawing our box. Luna SDK provides all rendering features through `RHI` module, which is the abbreviation of *Rendering Hardware Interface*. To use RHI module, we need to include its header first:

```c++
#include <RHI/RHI.hpp>
```

In Luna SDK, all graphics resources are related to one specific graphics device represented by `RHI::IDevice`, which is the virtual representation of the physical graphics device on the platform, so we need to add one property to `DemoApp` to hold this device:

```c++
Ref<RHI::IDevice> dev;
```

When `RHI` module initializes, it automatically chooses the most suitable physical device and creates one `IDevice` instance for you, which can be fetched by `RHI::get_main_device()`. You may also create additional devices for special use, but in our `DemoApp`, we will stick to the default one  by adding the following line in the `lutry ` scope of `DemoApp::init`:

```c++
dev = RHI::get_main_device();
```

We can also import all RHI types and functions by `using namespace RHI;` so that we don't need to spell them all over the `init` function:

```c++
using namespace RHI;
```

The code of `DemoApp::init` should look similar to:

```c++
RV DemoApp::init()
{
    lutry
    {
    	luset(window, Window::new_window("DemoApp", Window::WindowDisplaySettings::as_windowed(), Window::WindowCreationFlag::resizable));
        window->get_close_event().add_handler([](Window::IWindow* window) { window->close(); });
        window->get_framebuffer_resize_event().add_handler([this](Window::IWindow* window, u32 width, u32 height) {
            lupanic_if_failed(this->resize(width, height));
            });

        dev = RHI::get_main_device();
        using namespace RHI;
        // New resource creation code goes here...
    }
    lucatchret;
    return ok;
}
```

Unless explicitly specified, all codes we need to add to `DemoApp::init` in the following sections are added to the end of `lutry` scope, not in the end of the function scope directly.

## Fetching command queue and creating command buffer

Luna SDK employs *deferred execution model*, where render and compute invocations are recorded as *commands* in *command buffers*, then submitted to GPU explicitly by submitting *command buffers* to *command queues*. The command buffer object manages memory allocated to store commands, it also tracks the execution state for commands in the buffer when the buffer is submitted for execution. The command queue is a FIFO message queue between the host program and GPU. The host program submits command buffers to the command queue, and GPU consumes command buffers from the queue and execute commands in the buffer. Command buffers in the same queue are guaranteed to execute one after another, the next command buffer will not be executed until the last command buffer is finished.

When `IDevice` initializes, it creates one or multiple command queues based on the physical device architecture and limitation. The user can use `IDevice::get_num_command_queues` to fetch the number of command queues present on the current device, and use `IDevice::get_command_queue_desc` to fetch the command queue description of each command queue. `get_command_queue_desc` returns one `CommandQueueDesc` structure, which is defined as follows:

```c++
struct CommandQueueDesc
{
	CommandQueueType type;
	CommandQueueFlag flags;
};
```

`CommandQueueType` indicates the type of the command queue. There are three different queue types: `graphics`, `compute` and `copy`. The copy queue only accepts copy commands, and is used for transferring data between different resources; the compute queue accepts copy and compute tasks, while the graphics queue accepts graphics, compute and copy commands. `CommandQueueFlag` indicates additional properties for the queue, including `CommandQueueFlag::presenting`, which indicates one command queue that supports swap chain presenting. 

In our program, we need to choose one command queue of `graphics` type, and has `CommandQueueFlag::presenting` flag present. We firstly need to add one property to `DemoApp` to store the command queue index we choose:

```c++
u32 queue;
```

Then the command queue can be fetched by adding the following codes to `DemoApp::init`:

```c++
queue = U32_MAX;
u32 num_queues = dev->get_num_command_queues();
for (u32 i = 0; i < num_queues; ++i)
{
	auto desc = dev->get_command_queue_desc(i);
	if (desc.type == CommandQueueType::graphics && test_flags(desc.flags, CommandQueueFlag::presenting))
	{
		queue = i;
		break;
	}
}
if(queue == U32_MAX) return BasicError::not_supported();
```

After we fetched the command queue, we need to create one command buffer to record commands that will be submitted to that queue. We firstly need to add one new property to `DemoApp` to hold the command buffer:

```c++
Ref<RHI::ICommandBuffer> cmdbuf;
```

Then we can create the command buffer by adding the following codes to `DemoApp::init`:

```c++
luset(cmdbuf, dev->new_command_buffer(queue));
```

When we create the command buffer, we should pass the index of the command queue that is attached to the command buffer. The created command buffer can only be submitted to the command queue specified when creating the command buffer. 

## Creating swap chain

The swap chain object contains resources that are used to present render results to our window. In order to create one swap chain, we firstly need to add one property to `DemoApp` to store the created swap chain:

```c++
Ref<RHI::ISwapChain> swap_chain;
```

In Luna SDK, the swap chain presentation is also a command that should be submitted using command queues, so we need to specify the command queue we need to use when creating swap chains like so:

```c++
luset(swap_chain, dev->new_swap_chain(queue, window, SwapChainDesc(0, 0, 2, Format::bgra8_unorm, true)));
```

The swap chain is described by one `SwapChainDesc` structure:

```c++
struct SwapChainDesc
{
	u32 width;
	u32 height;
    u32 buffer_count;
	Format pixel_format;
	bool vertically_synchronized;
};
```

When used for creating swap chains, you may pass `0` for `width` and `height` property, which indicates the system to use the window framebuffer size as the size of the swap chain.

The swap chain needs to be resized when the window framebuffer size is changed. This can be done by filling `DemoApp::resize` method with the following codes:

```c++
RV DemoApp::resize(u32 width, u32 height)
{
    lutry
    {
        using namespace RHI;
        if(width && height)
        {
            auto dev = get_main_device();
            luexp(swap_chain->reset({width, height, 2, Format::unknown, true}));
        }
    }
    lucatchret;
    return ok;
}
```

`ISwapChain::reset` will reset the swap chain according to the new swap chain description, we can use `Format::unknown` to tell the system to use the current back buffer format for the new back buffer. Note that on some systems, the resize event will be emitted with both `width` and `height` being `0` if the window is minimized. We cannot create one swap chain with zero width or height, so we should handle this case and resize the back buffer with only non-zero size values.

## Creating descriptor set layout and descriptor set

The *descriptor set* object stores descriptors that bind resources to graphics or compute pipeline. Descriptors have the following types:

1. Uniform buffer view, which binds constant global data to shaders.
2. Read buffer view, which binds buffers to shaders and enables load operations on the buffer data.
3. Read texture view, which binds textures to shaders and enables sampling and load operations on the pixel data.
4. Read write buffer view, which binds buffers to shaders and enables load, store and atomic operations on the buffer data.
5. Read write texture view, which binds textures to shaders and enables load, store, and atomic operations on the pixel data.
6. Sampler, which stores sampling settings and exposes those settings for shaders.

Every pipeline may bind multiple descriptor sets, every descriptor set may contain all kinds of descriptors listed above. The *descriptor set layout* object stores the layout of one descriptor set object, including the number of descriptors in the descriptor set and the property of each descriptor.

In order to create one descriptor set layout object, we need to fill one `DescriptorSetLayoutDesc` structure. Here is the definition of `DescriptorSetLayoutDesc` structure:

```c++
struct DescriptorSetLayoutDesc
{
	Span<const DescriptorSetLayoutBinding> bindings;
	DescriptorSetLayoutFlag flags = DescriptorSetLayoutFlag::none;
};
```

The descriptor set layout consists of multiple *bindings* specified by `DescriptorSetLayoutBinding`, each binding describes one range of the descriptor set:

```c++
struct DescriptorSetLayoutBinding
{
	DescriptorType type;
	u32 binding_slot;
	u32 num_descs;
	ShaderVisibilityFlag shader_visibility_flags;
};
```

the `type` property describes the type of this binding. All descriptors in the same binding must be the same type:

```c++
enum class DescriptorType : u32
{
	uniform_buffer_view,
	read_buffer_view,
	read_write_buffer_view,
    read_texture_view,
    read_write_texture_view,
	sampler
};
```

`binding_slot` and `num_descs` describes the binding slot range of this binding, starting from `0`. All slots in `[binding_slot, binding_slot + num_descs)` will be occupied by this binding and cannot be used by other bindings. If `num_descs` is greater than `1`, then this binding will be interpreted as one descriptor array in the shader. `shader_visibility_flags` specifies which shaders may access descriptors in this binding, you may restrict the visibility of one binding to one set of specific shaders, which may improve performance on some platforms.

We need to add two new properties to `DemoApp` to hold the descriptor set layout object and the descriptor set object:

```c++
Ref<RHI::IDescriptorSetLayout> dlayout;
Ref<RHI::IDescriptorSet> desc_set;
```

We need **1** descriptor set with **1** constant buffer view, **1** shader resource view and **1** sampler. So we can create our descriptor set layout object in `DemoApp::init` like so:

```c++
luset(dlayout, dev->new_descriptor_set_layout(DescriptorSetLayoutDesc({
    {DescriptorType::uniform_buffer_view, 0, 1, ShaderVisibilityFlag::vertex},
    {DescriptorType::read_texture_view, 1, 1, ShaderVisibilityFlag::pixel},
    {DescriptorType::sampler, 2, 1, ShaderVisibilityFlag::pixel}
})));
```

Then we can create one descriptor set using the descriptor set layout object:

```c++
luset(desc_set, dev->new_descriptor_set(DescriptorSetDesc(dlayout)));
```

We will fill descriptors in the set by calling `update_descriptors` later.

## Compiling shaders

The next thing to do is compiling shaders for the pipeline state object. Luna SDK uses HLSL as the source shader language, and uses `ShaderCompiler` module to compile HLSL to DXBC, DXIL, SPIR-V and other target shading languages. To compile shader, we need to include corresponding header files:

```c++
#include <ShaderCompiler/ShaderCompiler.hpp>
#include <RHI/ShaderCompileHelper.hpp>
```

`ShaderCompileHelper.hpp` includes `RHI::get_current_platform_shader_target_format()` function, which tell the shader compiler the native target target shader format for the current graphics API. Since our shader is rather simple, we declare our shader source code directly in the C++ source file, in `DemoApp::init` function:

```c++
const char vs_shader_code[] = R"(
cbuffer vertexBuffer : register(b0)
{
    float4x4 world_to_proj;
};
struct VS_INPUT
{
    [[vk::location(0)]]
    float3 position : POSITION;
    [[vk::location(1)]]
    float2 texcoord : TEXCOORD;
};
struct PS_INPUT
{
    [[vk::location(0)]]
    float4 position : SV_POSITION;
    [[vk::location(1)]]
    float2 texcoord : TEXCOORD;
};
PS_INPUT main(VS_INPUT input)
{
    PS_INPUT output;
    output.position = mul(world_to_proj, float4(input.position, 1.0f));
    output.texcoord = input.texcoord;
    return output;
})";

const char ps_shader_code[] = R"(
Texture2D tex : register(t1);
SamplerState tex_sampler : register(s2);
struct PS_INPUT
{
    [[vk::location(0)]]
    float4 position : SV_POSITION;
    [[vk::location(1)]]
    float2 texcoord : TEXCOORD;
};
[[vk::location(0)]]
float4 main(PS_INPUT input) : SV_Target
{
    return float4(tex.Sample(tex_sampler, input.texcoord));
})";
```

here we use C++ raw string syntax `R"()"` to declare multiline string without appending `\` for every string line. Note the register number specified in shader must match the binding slot specified in descriptor set layout we just created. Since we use the same slot numbering system for all descriptor types, the register number for `b`, `t`, `u` and `s` should not overlap.

Then we can compile shaders using `ShaderCompiler::ICompiler` object:

```c++
auto compiler = ShaderCompiler::new_compiler();
compiler->set_source({ vs_shader_code, strlen(vs_shader_code) });
compiler->set_source_name("DemoAppVS");
compiler->set_entry_point("main");
compiler->set_target_format(RHI::get_current_platform_shader_target_format());
compiler->set_shader_type(ShaderCompiler::ShaderType::vertex);
compiler->set_shader_model(6, 0);
compiler->set_optimization_level(ShaderCompiler::OptimizationLevel::full);
luexp(compiler->compile());
auto vs_data = compiler->get_output();
Blob vs(vs_data.data(), vs_data.size());

compiler->reset();
compiler->set_source({ ps_shader_code, strlen(ps_shader_code) });
compiler->set_source_name("DemoAppPS");
compiler->set_entry_point("main");
compiler->set_target_format(RHI::get_current_platform_shader_target_format());
compiler->set_shader_type(ShaderCompiler::ShaderType::pixel);
compiler->set_shader_model(6, 0);
compiler->set_optimization_level(ShaderCompiler::OptimizationLevel::full);
luexp(compiler->compile());
auto ps_data = compiler->get_output();
Blob ps(ps_data.data(), ps_data.size());
```

The shader compilation process is fairly simple, we just set source code, compilation settings, then triggers the compilation. The compilation result will be given by `get_output`, we use one `Blob` object , a container for binary data, to hold the compilation result. The compiled shader data will be used when creating pipeline state object later.

## Creating shader input layout and pipeline state

The graphics and compute pipeline state is described by two objects: shader input layout object and pipeline state object. Shader input layout object stores the shader binding layout information for all shader stages, while pipeline state object stores pipeline settings for all graphics stages. 

Shader input layout is described by the `ShaderInputLayoutDesc` structure, which is set by specifying layouts of descriptor sets that will be bound to this pipeline and flags that specifies shaders that are allowed to access shader inputs.

```c++
struct ShaderInputLayoutDesc
{
	Span<IDescriptorSetLayout*> descriptor_set_layouts;
	ShaderInputLayoutFlag flags;
};
```

We need to add one new property to `DemoApp` to hold the shader input layout object:

```c++
Ref<RHI::IShaderInputLayout> slayout;
```

Then we can create shader input layout object using the following code:

```c++
luset(slayout, dev->new_shader_input_layout(ShaderInputLayoutDesc({dlayout}, 
    ShaderInputLayoutFlag::allow_input_assembler_input_layout)));
```

The pipeline object is described by the `GraphicsPipelineStateDesc` structure or the `ComputePipelineStateDesc` structure. Since we are creating one graphics pipeline, we need to fill the `GraphicsPipelineStateDesc`  structure, which is a complex structure that contains all pipeline settings for one graphics pipeline:

```c++
struct GraphicsPipelineStateDesc
{
	InputLayoutDesc input_layout;
	IShaderInputLayout* shader_input_layout = nullptr;
	Span<const byte_t> vs;
	Span<const byte_t> ps;
	RasterizerDesc rasterizer_state;
	DepthStencilDesc depth_stencil_state;
	BlendDesc blend_state;
	IndexBufferStripCutValue ib_strip_cut_value = IndexBufferStripCutValue::disabled;
	PrimitiveTopology primitive_topology = PrimitiveTopology::triangle_list;
	u8 num_color_attachments = 0;
	Format color_formats[8] = { Format::unknown };
	Format depth_stencil_format = Format::unknown;
	u32 sample_count = 1;
	u32 sample_mask = 0xFFFFFFFF;
};
```

Most graphic settings are similar to those in D3D11, D3D12, OpenGL or Vulkan, we will not explain these settings, but only gives the code that correctly sets every setting of the pipeline. You can see docs for `RHI` module for detailed explanations of these settings.

We need to add one new property to `DemoApp` to hold the pipeline state object:

```c++
Ref<RHI::IPipelineState> pso;
```

Then we can create pipeline state object using the following code:

```c++
GraphicsPipelineStateDesc ps_desc;
ps_desc.primitive_topology = PrimitiveTopology::triangle_list;
ps_desc.sample_mask = U32_MAX;
ps_desc.rasterizer_state = RasterizerDesc(FillMode::solid, CullMode::back, 0, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0, false, true, false, false, false);
ps_desc.depth_stencil_state = DepthStencilDesc(true, true, ComparisonFunc::less_equal, false, 0x00, 0x00, DepthStencilOpDesc(), DepthStencilOpDesc());
ps_desc.ib_strip_cut_value = IndexBufferStripCutValue::disabled;
InputAttributeDesc input_attributes[] = {
    InputAttributeDesc("POSITION", 0, 0, 0, 0, Format::rgb32_float),
    InputAttributeDesc("TEXCOORD", 0, 1, 0, 12, Format::rg32_float)
};
InputBindingDesc input_bindings[] = {
    InputBindingDesc(0, 20, InputRate::per_vertex)
};
ps_desc.input_layout.attributes = {input_attributes, 2};
ps_desc.input_layout.bindings = {input_bindings, 1};
ps_desc.vs = vs.cspan();
ps_desc.ps = ps.cspan();
ps_desc.shader_input_layout = slayout;
ps_desc.num_color_attachments = 1;
ps_desc.color_formats[0] = Format::rgba8_unorm;
ps_desc.depth_stencil_format = Format::d32_float;
luset(pso, dev->new_graphics_pipeline_state(ps_desc));
```

## Creating depth textures

The next step is to create one depth texture that is used as the depth stencil attachment when drawing our box. Texture objects in Luna SDK are represented by `ITexture` interface, and are described by `TextureDesc` structure, which is defined as follows:

```c++
struct TextureDesc
{
	TextureType type;
	Format format;
	u32 width;
	u32 height;
	u32 depth;
	u32 array_size;
	u32 mip_levels;
	u32 sample_count;
	TextureUsageFlag usages;
	ResourceFlag flags;
}
```

`type` specifies the type of the texture, like `tex1d`, `tex2d`, etc. `format` specifies the pixel format of the texture. `usages` specifies all possible usages of the texture when being bound to a pipeline. `width`, `height` and `depth`  specifies the size of the texture. `array_size` specifies the number of texture elements if this texture object represents a texture array, otherwise `1` shall be specified. `mip_levels` specifies the number of mips that should be allocated for the resource, if this is `0`, the system allocates full mipmap chain for the resource. `sample_count` specifies the sampling count for MSAA textures. `flags` specifies additional features for the texture, like whether this texture can share memory with other resources.

To simplify the texture description, we can use static methods provided by `TextureDesc` to quickly construct `TextureDesc` structure:

```c++
TextureDesc TextureDesc::tex1d(Format format, TextureUsageFlag usages, u64 width, u32 array_size = 1, u32 mip_levels = 0, ResourceFlag flags = ResourceFlag::none);

TextureDesc TextureDesc::tex2d(Format format, TextureUsageFlag usages, u64 width, u32 height, u32 array_size = 1, u32 mip_levels = 0, u32 sample_count = 1, ResourceFlag flags = ResourceFlag::none);

TextureDesc TextureDesc::tex3d(Format format, TextureUsageFlag usages, u64 width, u32 height, u32 depth, u32 mip_levels = 0, ResourceFlag flags = ResourceFlag::none);
```

Back to our `DemoApp`, we need to add one new property to `DemoApp` to hold the depth texture:

```c++
Ref<RHI::ITexture> depth_tex;
```

Then we can create textures using the following code:

```c++
auto window_size = window->get_framebuffer_size();
luset(depth_tex, dev->new_texture(MemoryType::local, TextureDesc::tex2d(Format::d32_float, TextureUsageFlag::depth_stencil_attachment, window_size.x, window_size.y, 1, 1)));
```

The first parameter of `new_texture` is the memory type of texture memory. The memory type is defined by `MemoryType` enumeration, possible options include:

1. `local` - The memory can only be accessed by GPU, CPU access is disabled. This memory type is suitable for resources that will be frequently accessed by GPU.
2. `upload` - The memory can be written by CPU and read by GPU. This memory type is suitable for resources that should be updated by CPU frequently. Textures cannot be created in this heap.
3. `readback` - The memory can be written by GPU and read by CPU. This memory type is suitable for transferring data from GPU to CPU. Textures cannot be created in this heap.

Note that when retrieving window size for rendering, we need to call `IWindow::get_framebuffer_size` instead of `IWindow::get_size`, on some platforms the window size is not necessary measured in pixels, causing these two methods return different values.

Since we are using the window size as the depth texture size, the depth texture should also be recreated when the window size is changed. This can be done by adding the following code to the `DemoApp::resize` method:

```c++
luset(depth_tex, dev->new_texture(MemoryType::local, TextureDesc::tex2d(Format::d32_float, TextureUsageFlag::depth_stencil_attachment, width, height, 1, 1)));
```

## Creating buffers and uploading buffer data

The next step is to create buffers used in our `DemoApp`, including:

1. The vertex buffer and index buffer for our box mesh.
2. The uniform buffer for camera properties.

Firstly we need to define the vertex structure of our box. Adding the following code after the declaration of `DemoApp` structure:

```c++
struct Vertex
{
    Float3U position;
    Float2U texcoord;
};
```

`Float2U` and `Float3U` are vector types used in Luna SDK, which represent 2D and 3D vectors. In Luna SDK, we have 16-bytes aligned vector types `Float2`, `Float3`, `Float4`, and unaligned vector types `Float2U`, `Float3U` and `Float4U`. The aligned vector types are used for calculations, SIMD functions like `min`, `max`, `lerp`, `clamp` only accepts aligned types, while unaligned vector types are used for storing and transferring data, just like this case. The size of aligned vector types are all 16 bytes, while the size of unaligned types are 8, 12 and 16 for `Float2U`, `Float3U` and `Float4U`.

We need to add three new properties to `DemoApp` to hold the these three buffers:

```c++
Ref<RHI::IBuffer> vb;
Ref<RHI::IBuffer> ib;
Ref<RHI::IBuffer> ub;
```

As you can see, buffer objects are represented by `IBuffer` interface. Both `IBuffer` and `ITexture` interface inherits from `IResource` interface, which provides one method to fetch the underlying memory of the resource. Fetching the underlying memory enables the user to create aliasing resources that share the same memory, which is an advanced feature that will not be covered in this article.

One buffer resource is described by `BufferDesc` structure, which is defined as follows:

```c++
struct BufferDesc
{
	u64 size;
	BufferUsageFlag usages;
	ResourceFlag flags;
}
```

`BufferDesc` is rather simple compared to `TextureDesc`. `size` specifies the size of the buffer, `usages` specifies all possible usages of the buffer when being bound to the pipeline, and `flags` specifies additional features of the buffer, like whether this buffer can share memory with other resources. Then, we need to create the vertex buffer and index buffer for our box using the following code:

```c++
Vertex vertices[] = {
    {{+0.5, -0.5, -0.5}, {0.0, 1.0}}, {{+0.5, +0.5, -0.5}, {0.0, 0.0}},
    {{+0.5, +0.5, +0.5}, {1.0, 0.0}}, {{+0.5, -0.5, +0.5}, {1.0, 1.0}},
    {{+0.5, -0.5, +0.5}, {0.0, 1.0}}, {{+0.5, +0.5, +0.5}, {0.0, 0.0}},
    {{-0.5, +0.5, +0.5}, {1.0, 0.0}}, {{-0.5, -0.5, +0.5}, {1.0, 1.0}},
    {{-0.5, -0.5, +0.5}, {0.0, 1.0}}, {{-0.5, +0.5, +0.5}, {0.0, 0.0}},
    {{-0.5, +0.5, -0.5}, {1.0, 0.0}}, {{-0.5, -0.5, -0.5}, {1.0, 1.0}},
    {{-0.5, -0.5, -0.5}, {0.0, 1.0}}, {{-0.5, +0.5, -0.5}, {0.0, 0.0}},
    {{+0.5, +0.5, -0.5}, {1.0, 0.0}}, {{+0.5, -0.5, -0.5}, {1.0, 1.0}},
    {{-0.5, +0.5, -0.5}, {0.0, 1.0}}, {{-0.5, +0.5, +0.5}, {0.0, 0.0}},
    {{+0.5, +0.5, +0.5}, {1.0, 0.0}}, {{+0.5, +0.5, -0.5}, {1.0, 1.0}},
    {{+0.5, -0.5, -0.5}, {0.0, 1.0}}, {{+0.5, -0.5, +0.5}, {0.0, 0.0}},
    {{-0.5, -0.5, +0.5}, {1.0, 0.0}}, {{-0.5, -0.5, -0.5}, {1.0, 1.0}}
};
u32 indices[] = {
    0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3, 
    4, 5, 6, 4, 6, 7, 
    8, 9, 10, 8, 10, 11,
    12, 13, 14, 12, 14, 15,
    16, 17, 18, 16, 18, 19,
    20, 21, 22, 20, 22, 23
};
luset(vb, dev->new_buffer(MemoryType::local, BufferDesc(BufferUsageFlag::vertex_buffer | BufferUsageFlag::copy_dest, sizeof(vertices))));
luset(ib, dev->new_buffer(MemoryType::local, BufferDesc(BufferUsageFlag::index_buffer | BufferUsageFlag::copy_dest, sizeof(indices))));
```

We firstly define vertex and index data for our box, then we create two buffer resources to hold the vertex and index data. One buffer is created by calling `IDevice::new_buffer`, which is similar to `IDevice::new_texture`, but takes `BufferDesc` as the resource descriptor object. Since we only need to upload vertex and index buffer data once, these two buffers are created in local memory to achieve maximum GPU bandwidth.

We can use similar code to create the constant buffer for uploading camera properties, but there are two differences. First, the graphic device has alignment requirements for constant buffers, which can be fetched from `IDevice::get_uniform_buffer_data_alignment()`, so we use `align_upper` helper function to adjust the size of our uniform buffer resource to meet the alignment requirement. Second, since we need to update uniform buffer data once every frame, we should choose `upload` memory type instead of `local` to give host program direct access to that resource.

In our `DemoApp`, the data of the uniform buffer is the 4x4 world-to-project matrix of the camera. We need to add a new include file to use matrix types:

```c++
#include <Runtime/Math/Matrix.hpp>
```

then we can use the following code to create constant buffer:

```c++
auto ub_align = dev->get_uniform_buffer_data_alignment();
luset(ub, dev->new_buffer(MemoryType::upload, BufferDesc(BufferUsageFlag::uniform_buffer, align_upper(sizeof(Float4x4), ub_align))));
```

as you can see, `Float4x4` is the matrix type used in Luna SDK. We also have `Float3x3` for 2D affine transformations.

## Uploading vertex and index data

Now that we have created one vertex buffer and one index buffer, we need to upload vertex and index data to these buffers, so that they can be used by GPU correctly. As we have mentioned before, resources with `local` memory type can not be accessed by the host directly. To copy data between local memory and host memory, we can either use *staging buffers* to transfer the data manually, or we can use `RHI::copy_resource_data` to perform data copy automatically. We will show how to perform data copy in both approaches.

### Uploading data manually

In order to upload data to resources with `local` memory type, we need to create intermediate buffers with `upload` memory type, copy data to such buffers form the host, and use GPU to copy data from such buffers to resources with `local` memory type. Such intermediate buffers are usually called *staging buffers*, and are used frequently to copy data from host memory to device local memory. The following code shows how to upload data for our vertex and index buffer:

```c++
lulet(vb_staging, dev->new_buffer(MemoryType::upload, BufferDesc(BufferUsageFlag::copy_source, sizeof(vertices))));
lulet(ib_staging, dev->new_buffer(MemoryType::upload, BufferDesc(BufferUsageFlag::copy_source, sizeof(indices))));
void* vb_mapped = nullptr;
luexp(vb_staging->map(0, 0, &vb_mapped));
memcpy(vb_mapped, vertices, sizeof(vertices));
vb_staging->unmap(0, sizeof(vertices));
void* ib_mapped = nullptr;
luexp(ib_staging->map(0, 0, &ib_mapped));
memcpy(ib_mapped, indices, sizeof(indices));
ib_staging->unmap(0, sizeof(indices));
cmdbuf->set_context(CommandBufferContextType::copy);
cmdbuf->resource_barrier({
    BufferBarrier(vb, BufferStateFlag::automatic, BufferStateFlag::copy_dest),
    BufferBarrier(vb_staging, BufferStateFlag::automatic, BufferStateFlag::copy_source),
    BufferBarrier(ib, BufferStateFlag::automatic, BufferStateFlag::copy_dest),
    BufferBarrier(ib_staging, BufferStateFlag::automatic, BufferStateFlag::copy_source),
}, {});
cmdbuf->copy_buffer(vb, 0, vb_staging, 0, sizeof(vertices));
cmdbuf->copy_buffer(ib, 0, ib_staging, 0, sizeof(indices));
cmdbuf->submit({}, {}, true);
cmdbuf->wait();
cmdbuf->reset();
```

Firstly, we create two staging buffers `vb_staging` and `ib_staging`. These two buffers have the same size as `vb` and `ib` and use upload memory type, so they can be written by the host directly. Then, we use `IBuffer::map` to take pointers to the buffer memory, use `memcpy` to copy data to the memory, then use `IBuffer::unmap` to release the host access to the memory. `map` takes two integer parameters indicating the host reading range of the mapped memory, this should always be `0` if the memory type of the buffer is not `readback`, just like this case. `unmap` takes another two integer parameters indicating the host writing range of the mapped memory. in our case, we have written memory in `[0, sizeof(data))` range, so we should specify the range correctly. There is a special range `[0, USIZE_MAX)` that indicates the whole buffer memory is read or written, so we don't need to specify the size explicitly.

After we copy data to staging buffers, we need to tell GPU to copy data from staging buffers to GPU local resources. As we have mentioned before, to send commands to GPU, we need to record commands into command buffers, submit them to command queues, then waits for command buffers to be finished by GPU.

The first command we need to record is `ICommandBuffer::set_context`, which tells GPU to setup a copy context. There are three kinds of contexts that we can set: `graphics`, `compute` and `copy`, only one context can be set at one time. A context switch will discard all previous context state. For example, if you bind one pipeline state object and multiple resources to a graphics pipeline, they you switch the context to `compute`, then all these bindings will be lost, and you need to bind them again when you switch the context back to `graphics`. Most commands can only be recorded in proper contexts, for example, `set_graphics_xxx` and `draw_xxx` commands can only be recorded in `graphics` context, `set_compute_xxx` and `dispatch` commands can only be recorded in `compute` context, and `copy_xxx` commands can only be recorded in copy context.

After setting the proper context, we need to emit resource barriers to transfer resources used by GPU to compatible states. Resource barrier commands are recorded by `ICommandBuffer::resource_barrier`, and will be described later. After resources have been transferred into suitable states, we call `ICommandBuffer::copy_buffer` to record one buffer-to-buffer copy command. 

When we finish recording commands into the command buffer, we call `ICommandBuffer::submit` to submit the command buffer to the command queue, call `ICommandBuffer::wait` to wait for the command buffer to be finished, then call `ICommandBuffer::reset` to clear commands in the command buffer, and reset the command buffer state so that it can be used for a recording new commands.

### Uploading data using `RHI::copy_resource_data`

In order to use `RHI::copy_resource_data`, we need to include one new header file:

```c++
#include <RHI/Utility.hpp>
```

`RHI/Utility.hpp` is an auxiliary library that defines high-level functionalities implemented using APIs provided by `RHI`, including `RHI::copy_resource_data` we use here. The following code shows how to upload data using `RHI::copy_resource_data`:

```c++
luexp(copy_resource_data(cmdbuf, {
    CopyResourceData::write_buffer(vb, 0, vertices, sizeof(vertices)),
    CopyResourceData::write_buffer(ib, 0, indices, sizeof(indices))
}));
```

You can see how `RHI::copy_resource_data` greatly simplifies the code we need to write in order to upload resource data.

## Loading image from file

The next step is to load our Luna LOGO image that will be drawn on the box surface:

![](luna.png)

Save the image file in the same directory as `main.cpp`, and naming it `luna.png`. You should have one file structure similar to this:

```
DemoApp
|- xmake.lua
|- main.cpp
|- luna.png
```

Then fills `xmake.lua` with the following code:

```lua
target("DemoApp")
    set_luna_sdk_program()
    add_files("**.cpp")
    add_deps("Runtime", "Window", "RHI", "ShaderCompiler", "Image")
    before_build(function(target)
        os.cp("$(scriptdir)/luna.png", target:targetdir() .. "/luna.png")
    end)
    after_install(function (target)
        os.cp(target:targetdir() .. "/luna.png", target:installdir() .. "/bin/luna.png")
    end)
target_end()
```

This script triggers registers custom functions before building the program and after installing the program, the custom function copies the image file to same the directory of our program binary file, so that our program can correctly find the image file.

Then, go back to `main.cpp`, and add one new property to `DemoApp` to represent the loaded image:

```c++
Ref<RHI::ITexture> file_tex;
```

To load the image in our program, we need to use one new module called `Image`, which parses image file data and gives row-majored image data in our desired format. We also need to use the file API provided by `Runtime` module, so we includes two new headers:

```c++
#include <Runtime/File.hpp>
#include <Image/Image.hpp>
```

The first thing to do is to load image file data from our `luna.png` file. In order to load file data, we need to use the `open_file` function provided by the `Runtime` module. This function returns one file handle represented by `IFile` if the file is correctly opened. Then, we loads the file data into one `Blob` object by calling `load_file_data`, this function creates one properly-sized blob object, and calls `IFile::read` to read all data of the file to the blob, then returns the blob:

```c++
lulet(image_file, open_file("Luna.png", FileOpenFlag::read, FileCreationMode::open_existing));
lulet(image_file_data, load_file_data(image_file));
```

Now that the file data has been stored in `image_file_data`, we need to call `Image::read_image_file` function to parse the file data and gives the real image data:

```c++
Image::ImageDesc image_desc;
lulet(image_data, Image::read_image_file(image_file_data.data(), image_file_data.size(), Image::ImagePixelFormat::rgba8_unorm, image_desc));
```

`Image::read_image_file` function outputs one `Image::ImageDesc` structure that describes the returned image data, including the width, height and pixel format of the image. The image data is arranged in a row-major manner and without and alignment padding. We can now creates the texture resource based on the image size:

```c++
luset(file_tex, dev->new_texture(MemoryType::local, TextureDesc::tex2d(Format::rgba8_unorm, 
    TextureUsageFlag::copy_dest | TextureUsageFlag::read_texture, image_desc.width, image_desc.height, 1, 1)));
```

The following code shows how to upload data for our texture:

```c++
u64 tex_size, tex_row_pitch, tex_slice_pitch;
dev->get_texture_data_placement_info(image_desc.width, image_desc.height, 1, Format::rgba8_unorm, &tex_size, nullptr, &tex_row_pitch, &tex_slice_pitch);
lulet(file_tex_staging, dev->new_buffer(MemoryType::upload, BufferDesc(BufferUsageFlag::copy_source, tex_size)));
void* file_tex_mapped = nullptr;
luexp(file_tex_staging->map(0, 0, &file_tex_mapped));
memcpy_bitmap(file_tex_mapped, image_data.data(), image_desc.width * 4, image_desc.height, tex_row_pitch, image_desc.width * 4);
file_tex_staging->unmap(0, USIZE_MAX);
cmdbuf->set_context(CommandBufferContextType::copy);
cmdbuf->resource_barrier({
    BufferBarrier(file_tex_staging, BufferStateFlag::automatic, BufferStateFlag::copy_source)
}, {
    TextureBarrier(file_tex, TEXTURE_BARRIER_ALL_SUBRESOURCES, TextureStateFlag::automatic, TextureStateFlag::copy_dest)
});
cmdbuf->copy_buffer_to_texture(file_tex, SubresourceIndex(0, 0), 0, 0, 0, file_tex_staging, 0, tex_row_pitch, tex_slice_pitch, image_desc.width, image_desc.height, 1);
cmdbuf->submit({}, {}, true);
cmdbuf->wait();
cmdbuf->reset();
```

Uploading texture data is similar to uploading buffer data, we need to create one staging buffer to hold the texture data, then use `ICommandBuffer::copy_buffer_to_texture` to copy data from buffer to texture. Note that most systems have special alignment requirements for texture data in buffers when copying data between buffers and textures, the user should call `IDevice::get_texture_data_placement_info` to fetch the texture data placement information for one specific texture, and use that information to manipulate texture data in the buffer. Instead of `memcpy` , the user should call `memcpy_bitmap` to copy row-major bitmap data, which takes `src_row_pitch` and `dst_row_pitch` to correctly offsets every texture data row.

We can also use `RHI::copy_resource_data` to upload data for textures like so:

```c++
luexp(copy_resource_data(cmdbuf, {
    CopyResourceData::write_texture(file_tex, SubresourceIndex(0, 0), 0, 0, 0, 
        image_data.data(), image_desc.width * 4, image_desc.width * image_desc.height * 4, image_desc.width, image_desc.height, 1)
}));
```

## Set up descriptor set

Once the uniform buffer and file texture is set up, we can bind these two resources to the descriptor set by calling `IDescriptorSet::update_descriptors`. We also need to set the sampler in the descriptor set to be used by the pixel shader.

```c++
luexp(desc_set->update_descriptors({
    WriteDescriptorSet::uniform_buffer_view(0, BufferViewDesc::uniform_buffer(ub)),
    WriteDescriptorSet::read_texture_view(1, TextureViewDesc::tex2d(file_tex)),
    WriteDescriptorSet::sampler(2, SamplerDesc(Filter::min_mag_mip_linear, TextureAddressMode::clamp, TextureAddressMode::clamp, TextureAddressMode::clamp))
}));
```

This concludes the `DemoApp::init` function.

## Camera control

Now that we have created all resources required to draw the box, we need to fill the actual drawing code in `DemoApp::update`. To make our program more interesting, we can apply one simple animation that rotates the camera around the box. We firstly adds one new property to `DemoApp` that stores the rotation angle of the camera:

```c++
f32 camera_rotation = 0.0f;
```

We can increase the rotation angle of the camera by one at every frame by adding the following line to the end of `DemoApp:update`:

```c++
camera_rotation += 1.0f;
```

Since we are going to use many functions that may throw errors, it is better to declare one `lutry`-`lucatch` scope that wraps all succeeding codes in `DemoApp:update`. Also, we don't want to render the image if the window is closed or minimized, so we add two early-out conditions after `Window::poll_events()`. Now `DemoApp::update` should look like this:

```c++
RV DemoApp::update()
{
    Window::poll_events();
    if(window->is_closed()) return ok;
    if(window->is_minimized()) return ok;
    lutry
    {
        camera_rotation += 1.0f;
        // More codes goes here...
    }
    lucatchret;
    return ok;
}
```

After we updates the camera rotation, we need to calculate the view-projection matrix for the camera. Fortunately, the math library of the `Runtime` module already includes implementations for many commonly used vector and matrix calculations, and here we are going to use two of them: `AffineMatrix::make_look_at` and `ProjectionMatrix::make_perspective_fov`. To use these two functions, we firstly need to add one new header file:

```c+
#include <Runtime/Math/Transform.hpp>
```

Then the matrix can be computed using the following code:

```c++
Float3 camera_pos(cosf(camera_rotation / 180.0f * PI) * 3.0f, 1.0f, sinf(camera_rotation / 180.0f * PI) * 3.0f);
Float4x4 camera_mat = AffineMatrix::make_look_at(camera_pos, Float3(0, 0, 0), Float3(0, 1, 0));
auto window_sz = window->get_framebuffer_size();
camera_mat = mul(camera_mat, ProjectionMatrix::make_perspective_fov(PI / 3.0f, (f32)window_sz.x / (f32)window_sz.y, 0.001f, 100.0f));
```

`AffineMatrix::make_look_at` generates one camera view matrix from the position of the camera and the position of the point to look at. `ProjectionMatrix::make_perspective_fov` is another helper function that generates one projection matrix from the specified field-of-view and aspect ratio values. Those two matrices are multiplied by `mul` function to get the final view-projection matrix. Note that when performing matrix multiplications, use `mul` instead of operator `*`, the later one is used to multiply each element in the matrix separately.

After we get the matrix, we need to copy the matrix data to the uniform buffer resource like so:

```c++
void* camera_mapped;
luexp(ub->map(0, 0, &camera_mapped));
memcpy(camera_mapped, &camera_mat, sizeof(Float4x4));
ub->unmap(0, sizeof(Float4x4));
```

## Fetching the back buffer

In order to render contents to one window, we need to fetch back buffers managed by the window swap chain. The number of back buffers that are contained by a swap chain is determined by `SwapChainDesc::buffer_count`, which can be set when the swap chain is created or reset. At every frame, only one back buffer can be used for rendering, which can be fetched by calling `ISwapChain::get_current_back_buffer`:

```c++
lulet(back_buffer, swap_chain->get_current_back_buffer());
```

`ISwapChain::get_current_back_buffer` can be called multiple times during the same frame, and will return the same back buffer. The current back buffer will be switched when `ISwapChain::present` is called, the user should not use the back buffer in the previous frame after `ISwapChain::present` is called.

## Resource barriers

In Luna SDK, every graphic resource has one state that describes the current memory layout and pipeline access polity of the resource. Before we can issue draw calls, we need to transfer every resource we use to their correct states. Luna SDK requires the user to transfer the state explicitly by calling `ICommandBuffer::resource_barrier` with transition-typed resource barriers. In our example, we need to perform the following transitions:

```c++
cmdbuf->set_context(CommandBufferContextType::graphics);
cmdbuf->resource_barrier({
    BufferBarrier(ub, BufferStateFlag::automatic, BufferStateFlag::uniform_buffer_vs),
    BufferBarrier(vb, BufferStateFlag::automatic, BufferStateFlag::vertex_buffer),
    BufferBarrier(ib, BufferStateFlag::automatic, BufferStateFlag::index_buffer)
}, {
    TextureBarrier(file_tex, TEXTURE_BARRIER_ALL_SUBRESOURCES, TextureStateFlag::automatic, TextureStateFlag::shader_read_ps),
    TextureBarrier(back_buffer, SubresourceIndex(0, 0), TextureStateFlag::automatic, TextureStateFlag::color_attachment_write),
    TextureBarrier(depth_tex, SubresourceIndex(0, 0), TextureStateFlag::automatic, TextureStateFlag::depth_stencil_attachment_write)
});
```

One resource can have multiple states, so long as such states are compatible to each other. For example, one texture can have `TextureStateFlag::shader_read_vs` and `TextureStateFlag::shader_read_ps` at the same time if it will be accessed by both vertex and pixel shader, or can have `TextureStateFlag::shader_read_cs` and `TextureStateFlag::shader_write_cs` at the same time if it will be read and write by compute shader. Luna SDK internally tracks the current states for all resources, so we can set `before` states of resources to `automatic` in most cases, which tells the system to load the previous states automatically. Luna SDK also omits unnecessary barriers automatically.

## Drawing the box

Finally, we can issue the draw call that draws our box:

```c++
RenderPassDesc desc;
desc.color_attachments[0] = ColorAttachment(back_buffer, LoadOp::clear, StoreOp::store, Float4U(0.0f));
desc.depth_stencil_attachment = DepthStencilAttachment(depth_tex, false, LoadOp::clear, StoreOp::store, 1.0f);
cmdbuf->begin_render_pass(desc);
cmdbuf->set_graphics_shader_input_layout(slayout);
cmdbuf->set_graphics_pipeline_state(pso);
cmdbuf->set_graphics_descriptor_set(0, desc_set);
auto sz = vb->get_desc().size;
cmdbuf->set_vertex_buffers(0, {VertexBufferView(vb, 0, sz, sizeof(Vertex))});
sz = ib->get_desc().size;
cmdbuf->set_index_buffer(IndexBufferView(ib, 0, sz, Format::r32_uint));
cmdbuf->set_scissor_rect(RectI(0, 0, (i32)window_sz.x, (i32)window_sz.y));
cmdbuf->set_viewport(Viewport(0.0f, 0.0f, (f32)window_sz.x, (f32)window_sz.y, 0.0f, 1.0f));
cmdbuf->draw_indexed(36, 0, 0);
cmdbuf->end_render_pass();
```

The first thing to do is to begin a *render pass* that attaches one set of color attachments and/or the depth stencil attachment to the graphic pipeline, these textures are bound to the pipeline during the current render pass and cannot be changed, while all other settings (like shader input layout object, pipeline state object, descriptor sets, etc) can be changed within the same render pass.

The render pass begins with `ICommandBuffer::begin_render_pass`. In the render pass, we set up all pipeline settings, and bind all resources required for the current draw call, then calls `ICommandBuffer::draw_indexed` to issue the draw call based on the current settings. Then we should close the render pass by calling `ICommandBuffer::end_render_pass`. We won't go detail about the pipeline setup for this draw call, they should be familiar to you if you have been using other graphics API before. For further explanations, please consult the documentations for the `RHI` module.

Before we can submit our command buffer, we need to insert another resource barrier to transfer our back buffer into `TextureStateFlag::present` state. This is required for one back buffer to be successfully presented.

```c++
cmdbuf->resource_barrier({}, {
    TextureBarrier(back_buffer, SubresourceIndex(0, 0), TextureStateFlag::automatic, TextureStateFlag::present)
});
```

Finally, we submit our command buffer, waiting for its completion, and resets the command buffer for next frame:

```c++
luexp(cmdbuf->submit({}, {}, true));
cmdbuf->wait();
luexp(cmdbuf->reset());
```

## Presenting the render result

The last thing we need to do is to present our rendering result to the window. This is done by calling `ISwapChain::presnet`:

```c++
luexp(swap_chain->present());
```

This concludes the `DemoApp::update` function. Build and run `DemoApp`, if everything goes correctly, you will see a textured rotating box in the screen:
