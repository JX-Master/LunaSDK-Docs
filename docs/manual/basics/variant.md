# Variant

```
#include <Runtime/Variant.hpp>
```

`Variant` is a dynamic typed object that stores data in a schema-less (self-described) manner. `Variant` is used as a general way of representing data for purposes like [serialization and deserialization](serialization_and_deserialization.md).

## Variant type

The type of one `Variant` is represented by `Variant::Type` enumeration and can be fetched by calling `type` method. Luna SDK supports the following variant types:

1. Null
2. Number
3. String
4. Boolean
5. BLOB
6. Pointer
7. Array of variants
8. Associated array of variants

## Null variant

Variant can be `null`, which represents the absence of value for the variant object. Calling `type` of one null variant returns `Variant::Type::null`, and calling `valid` of one null variant returns `false`.

## Number variant

Number variant contains one number of integer or floating-point type. The number type of one number variant is represented by `Variant::NumberType` enumeration and can be fetched by calling `number_type` method. If the variant object is not a number type, `NumberType::not_number` will be returned.

The number value of the variant can be fetched by calling `unum`, `inum` and `fnum` methods, each of them returns the underlying number in specified format with implicit type conversion when needed. If the variant type is not `Variant::Type::number`, `0` or `0.0` will be returned.

One variant can be set to number by assigning it with one integer or floating-point value or instance.

## String variant

String variant contains one single string represented by a `Name` object. You can fetch the underlying string of one variant by calling `str()` method, which returns one empty string if the type of the variant is not `Variant::Type::string`. We also provide `c_str` method to fetch the string buffer quickly, which will return `""` if the variant is not `Variant::Type::string`.

One variant can be set to string by assigning it with one `Name` instance, one `String` instance, one string literal, or one zero-terminated `c8*` pointer instance.

## Boolean variant

Boolean variant contains only two kinds of values: `true` and `false`. The Boolean value of one variant can be fetched by calling `boolean` method, which returns `false` if the variant is not `Variant::Type::boolean`.

One variant can be set to Boolean by assigning it with one `bool` value or instance.

## BLOB Variant

BLOB variant contains one single binary large object. The data, size and alignment of the data can be fetched by calling `blob_data`, `blob_size` and `blob_alignment` methods. Note that `Variant` does optimizations for small blob data, so the blob data is not necessary represented by `Blob`. You may detach the blob data from the variant by calling `blob_detach`, which returns the blob data as a `Blob` object, and the variant will contain one empty blob after this operation.

One variant can be set to pointer by assigning it with one `Blob` value or instance.

## Pointer Variant

Pointer variant contains one type-less user pointer. The pointer is stored as-is and can be fetched by calling `pointer` method, which returns `nullptr` if the variant is not `Variant::Type::pointer`.

One variant can be set to pointer by assigning it with one pointer value or instance.

## Array of variants

Array variant contains one array of `Variant` objects, which acts as sub-objects of the current object. Note that `Variant` does optimizations for small array, so the array data is not necessary represented by `Vector<Variant>`.

## Associated array of variants

Associated array variant contains one set of `Variant` objects, which acts as sub-objects of the current object. Unlike array variants, objects in associated array variant are indexed by `Name` objects, and does not have a particular order. Note that `Variant` does optimizations for small array, so the array data is not necessary represented by `HashMap<Name, Variant>`.

For both array variants and associated array variants, `size` method returns the number of sub-objects in the array, and `empty` method returns `true` if `size()` returns `0`. The user can use subscript syntaxes (`[]`) to fetch elements in array variants (`[N]`) and associated array variants (`["Name"]`), if the specified element does not exist, one null variant will be returned. Using subscript syntaxes for variants with incorrect types always return null objects.

## Variant differential

```c++
#include <Runtime/VariantDiff.hpp>
```

Luna SDK comes with one variant differential library that computes and patches variant differences. `diff_variant` calculates the difference between `before` and `after` variant objects, and returns the difference as another variant object called `diff` object. `patch_variant_diff` applies `diff` object to `before` variant object to reproduce `after` object, and `reverse_variant_diff` removes the `diff` object from `after` object to reproduce `before` object. These functions are useful for implementing data versioning and undo/redo operations.

## JSON encoding

```c++
#include <Runtime/VariantJSON.hpp>
```

Luna SDK comes with one JSON encoding/decoding library for `Variant` objects. `json_write` encodes one `Variant` to one JSON text stream, while `json_read` decodes one JSON text stream to one `Variant` object.

When performing JSON encoding, `Variant` of `Variant::Type::pointer`will be ignored, and `Variant` with `Variant::Type::blob` will be encoded using [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding format.
