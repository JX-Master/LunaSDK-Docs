# Luna::JobSystem::finish_job_id

```c++
void finish_job_id(job_id_t job)
```

This function should only be called for job IDs allocated by [allocate_job_id](group___job_system_1ga832ccddd2391a3edf9663e14e138b105.md), never call this function for job IDs returned by [submit_job](group___job_system_1gabcf07bd4ba10790a7426b555ab541c17.md). See remarks of [allocate_job_id](group___job_system_1ga832ccddd2391a3edf9663e14e138b105.md) for details.
