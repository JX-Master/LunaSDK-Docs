# Luna::MemoryLayoutMember
Describes one member used by memory layouting algorithms. 

```c++
struct Luna::MemoryLayoutMember
```

## Properties
* [usize size](struct_luna_1_1_memory_layout_member_1a59f6400efda18d25d7b3cf3c2e7a3d3d.md)

    The size of this member in bytes. This property is filled by the user before calculating memory layouts. 

* [usize alignment](struct_luna_1_1_memory_layout_member_1a84c18f6f6874b7f530f0c3ffe156e3fb.md)

    The alignment requirement of this member in bytes. This property is filled by the user before calculating memory layouts. 

* [usize offset](struct_luna_1_1_memory_layout_member_1af54fc49734a070e8a5568b09bb23a9d5.md)
