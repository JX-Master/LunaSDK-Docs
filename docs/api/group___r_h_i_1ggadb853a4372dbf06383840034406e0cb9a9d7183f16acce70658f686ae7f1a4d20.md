# Luna::RHI::OcclusionQueryMode::binary

```c++
binary = 0
```

Begins a binary occlusion query. In this query mode, the stored value will be 0 if no pixel passes the depth/stencil test, and will be non-zero if any pixel passes the depth/stencil test. Note that the stored value is platform-dependent if it is not 0, and may not always be 1.
