# Luna::VG::COMMAND_CIRCLE_Q1

```c++
constexpr f32 COMMAND_CIRCLE_Q1 = 4.0f
```

The command code that draws one circle part in the first quadrant. 

This command takes 4 points: {COMMAND_CIRCLE_Q1, [R](struct_luna_1_1_r.md), BEGIN, END}* [R](struct_luna_1_1_r.md): The radius of the circle.

* BEGIN: The beginning angle of the circle part in degrees. The value should be in [0, 90].

* END: The ending angle of the circle part in degrees. The value should be in [0, 90].

 All circle drawing commands take three data points:

* [R](struct_luna_1_1_r.md): The radius of the circle.

* BEGIN: The beginning angle of the circle in degrees.

* END: The end angle of the circle in degrees. If the end angle is greater than the beginning angle, the circle is drawn counter-clockwisly, otherwise, the circle is drawn clockwisly.
