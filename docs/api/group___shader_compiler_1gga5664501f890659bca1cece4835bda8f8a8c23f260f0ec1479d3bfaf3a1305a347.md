# Luna::ShaderCompiler::MatrixPackMode::column_major

```c++
column_major = 0
```

Use column major pack mode. 

In column major pack mode, the matrix data is read as four columns, each column has four values arranged in memory continuously. This pack mode has slightly better performance than row major pack mode in certain hardware.
