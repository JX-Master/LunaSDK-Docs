# Luna::RHI::PrimitiveTopology::line_strip

```c++
line_strip
```

Draws line strip, where every vertex and its prior vertex in the vertex buffer specify two points of one line. 

If any of the two vertices is not valid (out of valid vertex draw range or indexed by strip cut value), the current line will not be drawn.
