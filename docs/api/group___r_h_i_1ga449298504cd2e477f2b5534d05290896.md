# Luna::RHI::copy_resource_data

```c++
RV copy_resource_data(ICommandBuffer *command_buffer, Span< const CopyResourceData > copies)
```

Copies data between host memory and resource memory. 

The system allocates one staging buffer for the copy internally. 

## Parameters
* *in* **command_buffer**

    The command buffer used to perform the data copy operation. The command buffer will be submitted, synchronized and reset before this function returns. 

* *in* **copies**

    A number of copy operations that should be performed. The user should batch copy operations into one `copy_resource_data` call as much as possible to reduce memory allocation and synchronization overhead.
