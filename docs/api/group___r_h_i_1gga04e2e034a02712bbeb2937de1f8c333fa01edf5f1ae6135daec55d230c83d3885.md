# Luna::RHI::PrimitiveTopology::triangle_strip

```c++
triangle_strip
```

Draws line strip, where every vertex and its prior two vertices in the vertex buffer specify three points of one triangle. 

If any of the three vertices is not valid (out of valid vertex draw range or indexed by strip cut value), the current triangle will not be drawn.
