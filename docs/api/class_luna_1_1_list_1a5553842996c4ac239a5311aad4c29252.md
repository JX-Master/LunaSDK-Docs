# Luna::List::splice

```c++
void splice(const_iterator pos, List &&other)
```

Transfers all elements from another list to this list. 

No memory allocation or element copy/move will be performed, this function transfers elements by changing their pointers directly so that they link to the new list. 

## Parameters
* *in* **pos**

    The iterator pointing to the position to insert the transferred elements. 

* *in* **other**

    The list to transfer elements from. This list will be empty after this operation.
