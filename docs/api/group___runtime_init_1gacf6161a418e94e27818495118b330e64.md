# Luna::close

```c++
LUNA_RUNTIME_API void close()
```

Closes Luna SDK. 

Call this function to close Luna SDK. Most features provided by Luna SDK are not available after Luna SDK is closed. Calling this function when Luna SDK is not initialized or already closed does nothing and returns directly.

Initialized modules  be closed by this function in the reverse order of their initialization order, so they don't need to be closed manually.
