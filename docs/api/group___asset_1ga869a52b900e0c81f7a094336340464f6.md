# Luna::Asset::set_asset_path

```c++
RV set_asset_path(asset_t asset, const Path &path)
```

Sets the asset VFS path. 

This function only changes the asset's metadata in the system, it will not save the modified metadata to metadata file, it will also not move any asset file on VFS. The user should move asset files manually before calling this function, and call [save_asset_meta](group___asset_1ga1477c0674fba3bcd108ab7c7909e410c.md) manually after this function.

The user can get files that should be moved by [get_asset_files](group___asset_1ga6f0d82ba87fd79c3932629c2d3c0cdf5.md). The user can also call [move_asset](group___asset_1ga19d9ff2b14c7e1c26eed9743cc70294c.md) to move asset files, change asset path and save asset metadata to file in one call, which is preferred if the user does not need to perform custom copy tasks. 

## Parameters
* *in* **asset**

    The asset handle of the asset to operate. 

* *in* **path**

    The new asset VFS path to set.
